`Tabor's concept can be used to derive stress-strain curves from load-displacement data in indentation experiments. Tabor's work mainly focused on determining the yield strength of materials from the hardness measurements. Here's a brief overview of Tabor's concept and a MATLAB script to derive stress-strain curves using Tabor's approach.

**Tabor's Concept:**

Tabor proposed a relationship between the hardness (H) and the yield strength (σy) of a material. According to Tabor's rule, the yield strength can be approximated as:
σy ≈ H / n

where n is a constant that typically ranges from 2 to 4, depending on the material.

In nanoindentation, hardness (H) can be calculated as the maximum load (Pmax) divided by the contact area (A). Combining this with Tabor's rule, you can estimate the yield strength from the load-displacement data.

Replace 'your_file.txt' with the name of your text file containing the load and displacement data. This script assumes that the data file is formatted with two columns, where the first column contains the load data and the second column contains the displacement data. Make sure the text file is in the same directory as the MATLAB script or provide the full path to the file.

This MATLAB script is a basic example and may not account for all factors or complexities that could arise in real-world nanoindentation experiments. You may need to modify it based on your specific requirements or the particularities of your data.
