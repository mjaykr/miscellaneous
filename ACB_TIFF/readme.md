The above MATLAB code is designed to read a multi-slice TIF image file, perform automatic brightness and contrast adjustment on each slice, and then save the adjusted slices back into a new output TIF file. The code starts by reading metadata about the input TIF file using `imfinfo`, which provides information about the number of slices (`num_slices`) present in the TIF file. The code then loops through each slice using a `for` loop. Inside the loop, each individual slice is read into a variable named `img` using `imread`. The image data is converted to a double-precision format using `im2double` for more accurate numerical operations. Brightness and contrast are then adjusted using the `imadjust` function, which employs `stretchlim` to calculate the limits for contrast stretching. After adjustment, the image is converted back to an 8-bit unsigned integer format using `im2uint8`. Finally, the adjusted slice is written back to an output TIF file (`output_filename`) using `imwrite`. The 'WriteMode' parameter in `imwrite` is set to either 'overwrite' (for the first slice) or 'append' (for subsequent slices), ensuring that all slices are stored in the same TIF file.
