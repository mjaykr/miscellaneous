Deriving stress-strain curves from load-displacement data using an elastic-plastic model involves fitting a constitutive model to the data, and then using that model to compute the stress and strain. Here, we'll use a simple elastic-plastic model, assuming linear elasticity followed by power-law hardening.

Linear Elasticity: σ = E * ε
Power-law Hardening: σ = K * ε^N
For simplicity, let's assume that the material follows linear elasticity up to the yield point and then follows power-law hardening. First, we'll convert the load-displacement data to stress and strain using a method such as the Oliver and Pharr method. Then, we'll fit the elastic-plastic model to the stress-strain data and plot the results.

Replace 'your_load_displacement_data.txt' with the name of your text file containing the load-displacement data. This script assumes that the data file is formatted with two columns, where the first column contains the load data and the second column contains the displacement data. Make sure the text file is in the same directory as the MATLAB script or provide the full path to the file.
