**Continuous Stiffness Measurement (CSM)** is a technique used during nanoindentation experiments, where the stiffness is continuously measured as a function of indentation depth. This allows obtaining the indentation modulus and hardness as a function of depth. These depth-dependent properties can then be used to derive the stress-strain curve, considering the material's response at different indentation depths.

Replace 'your_load_displacement_data.txt' with the name of your text file containing the load-displacement data. This script assumes that the data file is formatted with two columns, where the first column contains the load data and the second column contains the displacement data. Make sure the text file is in the same directory as the MATLAB script or provide the full path to the file.

Adjust the constants, such as the indenter tip radius and Poisson's ratio, according to your specific experimental setup and material properties.

Please note that this code provides a simple example of deriving stress-strain curves using the CSM technique. Depending on your specific problem and data, you may need to consider more complex analysis or additional factors, such as the effects of plastic deformation or creep.
