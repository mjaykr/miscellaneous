Inverse analysis techniques involve solving the inverse problem of determining the stress-strain relationship from the load-displacement data. In this case, we'll use a simple optimization algorithm to find the material parameters that minimize the difference between the experimental load-displacement curve and the curve predicted by the stress-strain model.
Replace 'your_load_displacement_data.txt' with the name of your text file containing the load-displacement data. This script assumes that the data file is formatted with two columns, where the first column contains the load data and the second column contains the displacement data. Make sure the text file is in the same directory as the MATLAB script or provide the full path to the file.

Adjust the initial guess for the material parameters and the load-displacement conversion functions according to your specific experimental setup and indentation geometry.

Please note that this code provides a simple example of an inverse analysis technique. Depending on your specific problem and data, you may need to use more advanced techniques or optimization algorithms to achieve accurate results.
